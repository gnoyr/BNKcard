/**
 * Event fired when a model is excluded from further execution due to a failure.
 * <p>
 * In multi-step metric evaluation, if a model fails at any step, it is excluded
 * from all subsequent steps. This event captures which model was excluded, at which
 * step it failed, and the error that caused the exclusion.
 * <p>
 * Exclusion events are accumulated by the metric and delivered as part of
 * {@link MetricEvaluationResult#getExclusions()}.
 *
 * <h3>Exclusion Strategy:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * Step 1: GenerateStatements
 *   model-1 success
 *   model-2 success
 *   model-3 FAILED  (excluded, recorded in MetricEvaluationResult)
 *
 * Step 2: EvaluateFaithfulness
 *   model-1 success    // Only successful models continue
 *   model-2 success
 *   // model-3 skipped
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Example:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public void afterMetricEvaluation(MetricEvaluationResult result) {
 *     for (ModelExclusionEvent event : result.getExclusions()) {
 *         log.warn("Model {} excluded after failing step {}: {}",
 *             event.getModelId(),
 *             event.getFailedStepName(),
 *             event.getCause().getMessage());
 *     }
