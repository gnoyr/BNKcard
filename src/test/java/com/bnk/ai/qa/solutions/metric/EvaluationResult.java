 * Rich evaluation result containing score, explanation, metadata, and execution details.

 * <pre>{@code
 * EvaluationResult result = metric.singleTurnEvaluate(config, sample);
 *
 * log.info("Metric: {}", result.getMetricName());
 * log.info("Score: {}", result.getScore());
 * log.info("Explanation: {}", result.getExplanation().getSimpleDescription());
